If you don't want to setup Randibooru yourself, feel free to [invite it](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=206203876095950850&scope=bot&permissions=19456) to a server of your choice. Note that the bot is hosted on a Raspberry Pi at home, so don't expect much uptime unless I get a proper hosting solution.
